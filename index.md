GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be used to bypass local security restrictions in misconfigured systems.

The project collects legitimate [functions][] of Unix binaries that can be abused to ~~get the f**k~~ break out restricted shells, escalate or maintain elevated privileges, transfer files, spawn bind and reverse shells, and facilitate the other post-exploitation tasks.

It is important to note that this is **not** a list of exploits, and the programs listed here are not vulnerable per se, rather, GTFOBins is a compendium about how to live off the land when you only have certain binaries available.

GTFOBins is a [collaborative][] project created by [Emilio Pinna][norbemi] and [Andrea Cardaci][cyrus_and] where everyone can [contribute][] with additional binaries and techniques.

If you are looking for Windows binaries you should visit [LOLBAS][].
