GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be exploited by an attacker to bypass local security restrictions.

The project collects legitimate functions of Unix binaries that can be abused to <strike>get the f**k</strike> break out restricted shells, escalate or maintain elevated privileges, transfer files, spawn bind and reverse shells, and facilitate the other post-exploitation tasks. See the full list of [functions](/functions/).

This was inspired by the [LOLBAS][] project for Windows.

GTFOBins is a [collaborative][] project created by [Emilio Pinna][norbemi] and [Andrea Cardaci][cyrus_and] where everyone can [contribute][] with additional binaries and techniques.
