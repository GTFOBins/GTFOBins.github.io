      `dstat` allows you to run arbitrary Python scripts loaded as "external plugins" if they are located in one of the directories, stated in the `dstat` man page under "FILES":

      - `~/.dstat/`
      - `(path of binary)/plugins/`
      - `/usr/share/dstat/`
      - `/usr/local/share/dstat/`

      Pick the one that you can write into. The plugin named `xxx` file name must be defined in the `dstat_xxx.py` file.
    contexts:
      sudo:
      unprivileged:
