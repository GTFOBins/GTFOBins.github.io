  mypy is a static type checker for Python. It can be abused to read arbitrary files via error messages and to write controlled output files using reporting options.
functions:
  file-read:
  - code: |-
      mypy secret.txt
    contexts:
      unprivileged:

          Parses arbitrary files and leaks content through error messages, exposing sensitive data.
  file-write:
  - code: |-
      mypy secret.txt --junit-xml filetest.txt
    contexts:
      unprivileged:
