      It can be used to write files using a specially crafted SMBIOS file that can be read as a memory device by dmidecode.
      Generate the file with [dmiwrite](https://github.com/adamreiser/dmiwrite) and upload it to the target.

      - `--dump-bin`, will cause dmidecode to write the payload to the destination specified, prepended with 32 null bytes.

      - `--no-sysfs`, if the target system is using an older version of dmidecode, you may need to omit the option.

      ```
      make dmiwrite
      echo DATA >/path/to/temp-file
      ./dmiwrite /path/to/temp-file x.dmi
      ```
