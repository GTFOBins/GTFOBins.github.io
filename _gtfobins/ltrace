      The data to be written appears amid the library function call log, quoted and with special characters escaped in octal notation. The string representation will be truncated, pick a value big enough instead of `999`. More generally, any binary that executes whatever library function call passing arbitrary data can be used in place of `ltrace -F DATA`.
