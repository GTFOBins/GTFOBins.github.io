  firejail is a sandboxing tool for Linux. It can be abused to spawn shells,
  read and write files outside the sandbox, and escalate privileges when misconfigured.
functions:
  file-read:
  - code: |-
      firejail --noprofile cat /path/to/file
    contexts:
      unprivileged:

  file-write:
  - code: |-
      firejail --noprofile sh -c 'echo data > /path/to/output'
    contexts:
      unprivileged:
