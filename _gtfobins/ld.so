  `ld.so` is the Linux dynamic linker/loader, its filename and location might change across distributions (e.g., `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`). The actual path is can be obtained with:

  ```
  strings /proc/self/exe | head -1
  ```
functions:
  shell:
  - code: |-
      /path/to/ld.so /bin/sh

      The spawned process will be the loader, not the target executable, this might aid evasion. See <https://shyft.us/posts/20230526_linux_command_proxy.html> for more information.
    contexts:
      sudo:
      suid:
        code: |-
          /path/to/ld.so /bin/sh -p
        shell: false
